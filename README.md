# STV Game Document

## Main Summary

#### Main objectives
The goal of the game is to slay the vampire who rules the castle (which is the map). 
The main objective of the game is to make your way through the castle without being killed by the vampire or his minions. 

### Mechanics

#### General mechanics
Throughout the game, you can attack the vampire to slow him down or halt him, but ultimately the only way to kill him is with holy water at the end of the game. 
This will be a first person game. The combat will be standard first person combat, where you have limited health, and can do 1 attack per input. Attacks can be ranged or melee.
The player has limited health but can heal themselves with bandages. This will happen in real time and take time, so the player will have to find safe places to do it. If they get hit, the healing will be interrupted.

#### Obstacles for the player
There will be multiple steps the player has to complete in order to create the holy water. This would consist of getting a vial, a holy symbol, then the chant to bless. After getting all three, you have to complete a ritual in order to bless the water.
There will also be minor hurdles such as locked doors, traps, enemies along the way. 
Throughout the journey, the player can aquire new weapons by finding them or from enemies.

There will be minor enemies in the form of vampire thralls. They will vary in difficulty as you get deeper into the castle.

#### Final Boss Fight

The final boss fight will consist of the player having to double task between fighting the vampire and making the holy water. The fight is won when the player can successfully make the water and try to douse the vampire in it. 

In order to have time for the holy water to be made, the player must actually attack the vampire to stun him for long enough. This will be measured by a sub-health bar where the player has to attack the vampire enough times to get him into a "frozen" stage.

The player has to douse the vampire 3 times. Each time the player successfully douses the vampire, he will morph into a new form, creating a new challenge for the player.

### Story

The player is a monster hunter, contracted with slaying the master vampire. The game will start with the player fighting the vampire, but they cannot beat the vampire this time as they do not have the ingredients for holy water.
